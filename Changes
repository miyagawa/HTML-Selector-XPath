      - Add CSS3 "=*" operator for real substring matching (Corion)
      - Add CSS3 ":first-of-type" and ":nth-of-type()" pseudo-attributes (Corion)
        (but if you're using them, you're likely better off using XPath already)
      - Add CSS3 "~" operator (Corion)
      - Adopt tests for "~" operator from RT #61990, by Aaron Crane (Corion)
      - Add :contains() selector (only immediate child nodes) (Corion)
      - Support implicit selectors like "> em" (translated to "* > em") (Corion)
        Fixes RT #50131 (Reported by David Wheeler)
      - Fix more implicit universal selectors (fixes RT #49982)
        :lang(c) as a bare selector works now (Corion, Aaron Crane)
