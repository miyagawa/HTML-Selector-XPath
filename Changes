Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Selector::XPath

0.07 to be released
      - Fix bug when combining selectors (p , q). Whitespace created invalid
        XPath expressions there. (Corion)
      - Fix bug when combining :root selectors as the second selector.
        The first selector was modified. (Corion)
      - :root now acts relative to the given "root" option,
        not the document root (Corion)

      - Add CSS3 "=*" operator for real substring matching (Corion)
      - Add CSS3 ":first-of-type" and ":nth-of-type()" pseudo-attributes (Corion)
        (but if you're using them, you're likely better off using XPath already)
      - Add CSS3 "~" operator (Corion)
      - Adopt tests for "~" operator from RT #61990, by Aaron Crane (Corion)
      - Add :contains() selector (only immediate child nodes) (Corion)
